# STRUDEL Ecosystem Governance
# [STRUDEL Product Working Groups Governance](#strudel-product-working-groups-governance)

Below is information on STRUDEL governance and how you can get involved as a working group member (i.e., maintainer). If you are interested in contributing on a short term basis, you do not need to join a working group; find more information on [contributing as an individual below](#contributing-as-an-individual). 

Product working groups may form or dissolve as the direction of STRUDEL evolves. All working group members must follow our [code of conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12hvQMM9EV-rr6j-yRmx2SOd615laKXQlCVhI_o5o304/edit?tab=t.g3e4lcd899sk#heading=h.tlejhb80vbhv).

**Responsibilities:** Working groups have the responsibility of maintaining STRUDEL products. Working groups need to have a clear set of goals and objectives. Any community member might propose a working group by emailing the Steering Committee (strudel-sc at lbl dot gov); this signals that the member will take ownership of their proposed work and will serve as a maintainer for the product/project. Working groups that are not active for over six months will be deactivated. The working group leads should communicate any changes in membership or scope to the steering committee. 

**Membership.**   
Working groups are composed of product maintainers—people with a long term responsibility for stewardship. (Some working group meetings might be open to the community). There must be at least one member (i.e., maintainer) identified at all times; at least three members are preferred. Members may be invited or can be nominated by themselves or another community member at any time. Members are expected to serve at least a six month term.

To become a formally recognized working group member, candidates should demonstrate long-term commitment to the project (e.g., through past contributions, hiring, funded proposals). All working group members should have a chance to discuss and vote on the induction of new members, whether they are self-nominated or invited. A majority of working group members’ votes are needed to induct a new member. Changes to the working group members should be communicated to the Steering Committee.

To step down as a working group member, send notice to all other members, ideally two weeks in advance. After your notice has been accepted, remove your name and contact information from any locations identifying you as an active maintainer and working group member. Be sure you have been credited for your work as well. The remaining working group members should pursue a replacement as needed.

If you are the only current working group member and wish to step down, contact the steering committee chair and delegate ownership of the working group to them. The steering committee can establish a successor immediately or re-establish the working group when need arises.

To remove a working group member from the project, all other members must discuss the change, giving two weeks for asynchronous engagement on the issue or to schedule a meeting for synchronous discussion. Through discussion or a subsequent vote, the members must reach a decision. If proceeding with removal, the steering committee should be informed and allowed three days to comment. If the steering committee agrees, notice should be sent to the to-be-removed member with an explanation of the cause. That person has the opportunity to respond and request a second vote. They are not entitled to a third vote. The list of working group members should be updated to reflect the new status.

**Coordination:** Working groups are expected to coordinate asynchronously as needed and may meet periodically (roughly quarterly). If meetings are held, some should be open to external contributors. An agenda should be made available to all STRUDEL community members in advance of any meetings so that Steering Committee members, working group members, and [individual contributors](#contributing-as-an-individual) can provide asynchronous input and so that those who cannot join may request decisions on a given topic be postponed. Meetings that are open to external contributors should be publicly advertised. Notes should be published in Github. Most agendas should include: 

* Updates on changes to the lesson content  
* Reflections on recent workshops  
* Reviewing open issues  
* Discussing the lesson roadmap (and possible additional lessons)   
* Planning future meetings

**Decision making.** Working group members will primarily make decisions through discussion. However, any member can call for a vote on any decision.

Working group members should actively seek input from other contributors when responding to substantial changes, e.g., by tagging others or inviting additional feedback before integrating any change. Working group members should use their best judgment to decide what is or is not a substantial change. Others have four weeks to give that additional feedback before the responding maintainer proceeds on the basis of [lazy consensus](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#LazyConsensus).

If a vote is called for: 

* All members should be contacted to initiate a vote  
* Voting may be synchronous or asynchronous  
* A majority of active members’’ votes are needed to make a substantial change  
   

If a working group member does not acknowledge or respond within two weeks to an invitation to vote on any topic, that member may be excluded from the decision making process. 

Working group members are expected to seek guidance from the Steering Committee when making decisions about:

* Membership changes  
* Team communications  
* Community building  
* Development roadmaps  
* Stewardship   
* Governance 

# STRUDEL Steering Committee {#strudel-steering-committee}

**Responsibilities.** The STRUDEL Steering Committee is primarily responsible for strategy, advocacy, and supporting product working groups. 

The Steering Committee must:

* Monitor the health of STRUDEL products and associated working groups  
* Pursue resources and funding when needed  
* Promote the project in relevant venues  
* Manage collaborations with other organizations  
* Ensure all working groups’ roadmaps and governance procedures are up-to-date in this document  
* Ensure all working groups’ roadmaps are in alignment with the STRUDEL vision  
* Enforce the STRUDEL code of conduct

This committee is expected to weigh in on decisions about:

* Working group membership   
* Team communications  
* Community building  
* Development roadmaps  
* Stewardship   
* Governance   
* Supporting funding proposals


Changes to any STRUDEL governance procedures or contribution guidelines must be reviewed by the Steering Committee. 

**Membership.** The Steering Committee should include at least three people at any given time. Members may be invited or can be nominated by themselves or another community member at any time. New members should be ratified by a majority vote of the Steering Committee. Members are expected to serve at least a two year term. A Steering Committee Chair will be selected annually by discussion (and, if necessary, vote). To step down as a Steering Committee member, send notice to all other members, ideally two weeks in advance. After your notice has been accepted, remove your name and contact information from any locations identifying you as a currently active Steering Committee member and ensure that you are listed as a former member in the list of committee members.

To remove a member from the Steering Committee, all other members must discuss the change, giving two weeks for asynchronous engagement on the issue or to schedule a meeting for synchronous discussion. Through discussion or a subsequent vote, the members must reach a decision. If proceeding with removal, notice should be sent to the to-be-removed member with an explanation of the cause. That person has the opportunity to respond and request a second vote. They are not entitled to a third vote. The list of Steering Committee members should be updated to reflect the new status.

**Coordination:** The Steering Committee is expected to communicate regularly through email. The committee should document discussion for any members who cannot participate.  Agenda for any meetings will be communicated in advance so working group members can provide asynchronous input and so that Steering Committee members who cannot join may request decisions on a given topic be postponed.

**Decision making.** The Steering Committee will primarily make decisions through synchronous discussion, though any member can call for a vote on any decision.   
If a vote is called for: 

* All members should be contacted to initiate a vote  
* Voting may be synchronous or asynchronous  
* A majority of members votes are needed to make a substantial change  
   

If a Steering Committee member does not respond within two weeks to an invitation to vote on any topic, that member may be excluded from the decision making process.

# Participating in STRUDEL 

## Contributing as an Individual {#contributing-as-an-individual}

STRUDEL sustains its work through multiple product-focused [working groups](#strudel-product-working-groups-governance), a [steering committee](#strudel-steering-committee) to guide them, and individual contributions. We encourage you to share your perspective and expertise through contributions to any of the STRUDEL products; you do not need to join a working group to do so. Your contributions, given at your convenience, will ensure we deliver high quality, usable resources designed for the scientific community.

If you would like **to** **make a contribution without committing to long-term involvement as a maintainer,** we encourage you to follow the contribution guidelines on the relevant product pages. 

If you would like **to become a maintainer and** **influence a product roadmap** and you are able to commit to at least a six month term, we encourage you to consider joining the relevant [working group](#strudel-product-working-groups-governance). 

All contributors are expected to follow the code of conduct.

## Organizational Collaborations

STRUDEL products are developed openly between working group members and the scientific community. Individuals may make contributions to a product according to its stated guidelines. 

If you wish to pursue a funded contribution to STRUDEL or a funded collaboration, contact the STRUDEL Steering Committee at [strudel-sc@lbl.gov](mailto:strudel-sc@lbl.gov). Please provide the following information as best you can:

* The proposed contribution or collaborative work   
* A brief statement explaining how the proposed work aligns with the STRUDEL Vision and any relevant product roadmaps  
* A brief statement explaining the benefit of the collaboration to you   
* A brief description of what staffing or resources you would bring and what you would expect from STRUDEL  
* What your anticipated role within STRUDEL would be—short term contributor, product working group member, or steering committee member?  
* The funding source or funding call and timeline for seeking it


A committee member will confirm receipt of your proposal idea, ask any follow up questions, and will discuss the idea with the full STRUDEL Steering Committee. The Steering Committee aims to respond to the proposal within one week.

When considering a formal collaboration with another organization, the STRUDEL Steering Committee will assess the opportunity along several dimensions:

* To what degree does the collaboration advance or sustain the STRUDEL Vision?  
* To what degree does the collaboration align with STRUDEL product roadmaps?  
* Does the potential partner organization and/or STRUDEL have appropriate staffing or resources to sustain the collaboration?  
* Does the potential partner organization demonstrate effective collaboration skills?

If a collaboration is established, the Steering Committee will meet to determine which product working groups the new partners should join and whether or not they need representation on the Steering Committee itself.
